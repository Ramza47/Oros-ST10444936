# <a name="_toc165830153"></a>1. Purpose

The “Tamagotchi app” is a virtual pet game that has three buttons, which you click on to select, and perform activities such as feeding Tamagotchi, playing games, and cleaning, up after the Tamagotchi, and checking your pet`s age, weight, happiness, and other kinds of features. The creator of Tamagotchi is Bandai, who invented it in 1955 in Japan. It provides as a digital adaptation of the classic virtual pet toy, allowing users to nurture and care for their virtual pets right from their mobile devices. And it is designed for both nostalgia and a new generation of players, The Tamagotchi app serves an interactive experience dating back of the original Tamagotchi. Any user from different age can engage with the app to experience the entertainment and responsibilities of pet ownership, whether for entertainment, stress relief, or a trip down memory lane. But however, the Tamagotchi app appeals to a diverse audience in the modern convenience and the users can spend much time on it as it also educates on how to also take care of your own pets. (Elyse, 2017).

When a user clicks on the “Feed” button, it will change the current pet`s image to match with Figure 3 and that will update the pet`s status such as hunger or health. When a user then clicks on “Clean” button, it will change the pet`s image from eating to cleaning as illustrated in Figure 5 and that will update the pet`s status to cleanliness. When a user then clicks on “Play” button, it will then change the pet`s current image from cleaning to Playing as illustrated in Figure 4 and that will update the pet`s status to keeping fitness.


## <a name="_toc165830155"></a>General Design

Yes, the app suits all kinds of users, and the design and pictures of the app will surely attract both children and adults as well, hence the welcome screen shows an enthusiastic pet happy. And the use of colour is dull and not bright for better eye vision.

## <a name="_toc165830156"></a>Intuitive Design

Yes, the design of the app is easy to follow as it ensures that users can navigate through Tamagotchi app easily and engage with the app`s features or functions without confusion or frustration. The consistent layout that maintains through the app helps users feel comfortable and easy to understand the interface such as buttons. The Tamagotchi app is also optimized for various screen sizes and devices which it adapts to different resolutions and orientations of different devices to provide a consistent experience for all kind of users. The app does not have too many elements or functions which is why the design should remain clear and focuses on the essential content and its serving purpose. However, the gesture support has pinching to perform actions within the app. It can also be accessed on offline mode without the use of internet connection.


## <a name="_toc165830157"></a>Content Prioritisation

Yes, the app displays the essential elements and functionalities such as the significance of the app which it has a main object which is a pet that appears on the center of the screen with no added features. And the app has the elements that the user would need which goes along with the app and the physical gadget made. Hence the app version has same functions and with not too many elements.

## `	`<a name="_toc165830158"></a>Legible Text Content

The fonts are clear and readable font size and spacing. There is no small text or fancy fonts that have been added which could strain the user`s eyes. Which this adds up to the intuitive design of the app. The app only contains few images which adds up to the purpose of the app. This, however, also helps to educate pet owners for their awareness of living as users engage with the app.

## `	`<a name="_toc165830159"></a>Interface Elements Visible
The users can easily navigate the app and there is a clear visual hierarchy, consistent layout, and interactive elements such as buttons which the user can make use of as the app does not contain text information only simple buttons which readable text. And the app does not contain crowded components.

## `	`<a name="_toc165830160"></a>Hand Position Controls

As stated in the intuitive design, the buttons are well easily navigated and structed correctly, and they are identifiable which makes it comfort for the users to reach them without stretching their thumb finger.

## `	`<a name="_toc165830161"></a>Images

The images I chose they convey an illustration which users can tell of what it is happening in the image. The Images will draw the users as they engage with the app such as the welcoming screen that shows a smiling pet and would leave the user with some thoughts hence the placement of the image serves a deliberate purpose. And other images in second layout of the app, they also draw a composition which interacts with user`s controllability when they click on a certain button that performs an action with that image. Moreover, the images can also evoke a certain mood and reflects to the user`s interests.

# <a name="_toc165830162"></a>3. GitHub and GitHub Actions

## <a name="_toc165830163"></a>Version Control with GitHub

1) **Create a new GitHub Repository:** After a new Repository is created in the GitHub website, the repository should contain a student number and a name with a description, and it has been set to public.

1) **Initialise the Repository with a README File:** After the repository is created, an option to “Initialize this repository with a README” will appear. Then check the option to create a README file. 

   Clink on the “Create repository” button to finalize the creation of the repository. 

1) **Commit and push your project files to the GitHub Repository:** In Android studio, locate VCS (Version Control System) \ Import into Version Control\ Share project on GitHub.

   Afterwards click the “Share” button to push the project files to the GitHub repository.

1) **Regularly Commit and push your code as you make progress:** After the initial push, continue making changes to your project in Android Studio.

   After making significant changes, always commit your changes locally in Android Studio using VSC -> Commit Changes.

   Once committed, push your changes to GitHub repository using VSC -> Git -> Push.

## <a name="_toc165830164"></a>Test and Automated Testing

1) **Conduct Manual testing:**

   Manually test your app to ensure if functions seamlessly and offers an enjoyable educational experience for users.

1) **Create a New Test Class:** In your Android Project, create a new Kotlin file for your test class. Name it appropriately to indicate what component or functionality you are testing.

1) **Write Test methods:** Give test methods.

1) **Run the Tests:** Run the tests using the testing framework`s tools provided by Android Studio or through the command line.
